I am Nelson Rojas, an outgoing, kind, and persevering individual
with a passion for **web development**.


Since 4 years ago, I have been self-taught in front-end development,
dedicating myself to mastering technologies with discipline and
determination.


Through a solid learning path, constant practice, and project
creation, I have honed my technical skills and gained a better
understanding of user needs.


Each project has allowed me to deepen my knowledge, and my passion
drives me to continue **learning** and **improving**.
